# 1- Goal and Requirements
The application developed was designed to allow users to register for the desired in a term. The application displays the list of courses in a dropdown menu when clicked on. In a text box below the dropdown menu, the listed of courses registered for is displayed after the registration button is clicked. Another text box displays the total of credit hours registered for. The application also informs the user if the registration succed or if it fails because the selected course is already in the registered list or because the user exceeds the maximum amount of credit hours, which is 9.

# What was Well done
 The Logic of the code was well done. Comments were also included where necessary to explain what was being acheived. Various c# concepts such conditional statements, variables, methods, loops, and classes were used to make the code more functional, readable, and maintainable.

# Console vs WPF
A console applications are interactively text based display prompts and data in Command line interfaces. These apps are executed from command lines or terminals and Input and output are displayed through command prompts.
WPF apps on the otherhand, use rich, interactive, and appealing graphical interfaces. They can be made of multiple type of components or visual elements such as buttons, textboxes and their labels. In the case of this of application, a dropdown menu, a button, 2 textboxes, and their respective labels where used to implement the UI. This design was successful because it properly informed users of the purpose of each component. 

# Debugging
Debugging the apps consisted in identifying syntax errors and warnings returned by Visual studio which often provided explanaitions for these errors. Theses descriptions would sometime point to methods having inpropriate return type and/or statements, Invalid variable declaration, initialization, and assignment.  A technique useful during the debugging process included using Visual Studio's debugger, which allowed us to step into code line after line while the application was running. This method allowed us to view changes in the application in real time and identify runtime errors in the logic of code.
