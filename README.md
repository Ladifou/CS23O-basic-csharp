# Well done
Logic of the code was well done. 
Commenting where necessary.
Use of various c# concepts such conditional statements, variables, methods, loops, and classes.

# Console vs WPF
A console applications are interactively text based display prompts and data in Command line interfaces. These apps are executed from command lines or terminals and Input and output are displayed through command prompts.
WPF apps on the otherhand, use rich, interactive, and appealing graphical interfaces. They can be made of multiple type of components/ visual elements such as buttons, textboxes and their labels.

# Debugging
Debugging the apps consisted in identifying syntax errors and warnings returned by Visual studio which often provided explanaitions for these errors. Theses descriptions would sometime point to methods having inpropriate return type and/or statements, Invalid variable declaration, initialization, and assignment.  A technique useful during the debugging process included using Visual Studio's debugger, which allowed us to step into code line after line while the application was running. This method allowed us to view changes in the application in real time and identify runtime errors in the logic of code.
